## Information Problem:

#### Graduate students have a difficult time finding classes that align with their interest and at the same time fulfill their course requirements.

### Stakeholders & Target Browsers:
* Stakeholders will include the office of registar and Graduate students of the Univversity of Maryland, along with UMD adminsitration
* Our target browser will be focused towards the majority, Android users

## Data:
* We utilized the UMD.io API in order to pull class information
* server.js allowed us to fetch information from the API
* Bulma
## Strategies & Solutions:
* We used figma in order to create a wireframe of how we wanted each page to look on both desktop and mobile views
* Our team decided to use Bulma in order to improve the structure and layout of our application

## Technical Rationale:

## Problem Addressed 

## Challenges:
* The UMD.io API caused some issues when it came to retrieving data. This caused us to divert from the original plan and narrow the scope of our design.
* Could not include all the desired features due to API limitations.
* Each teammate had a different approach to coding our applications. Having diffrent approaches/styles of solving the problem may have contributed to having a more complex code than necessary.

## Future Direction:
* Improve application layout/structure
* Use a better API source
